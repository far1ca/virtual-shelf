# virtual-shelf

Angular + Express website for displaying your very own bookshelf

Want to display all the books you've read on a bookshelf? Look no further! Using this website you can add books to your very own bookshelf. Customize the color, add comments/reviews for each book, and enjoy the cozy result!

I was inspired to make the virtual shelf because I wanted to have a place where I can keep track of all my favorite reads along with descriptions and reasons why I liked them so much.

The most challenging part of making this was learning how to host both the frontend and backend. It was also my first time using Express.js so it was a bit of a learning curve.
